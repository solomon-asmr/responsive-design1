            The evolution of the world's transportation system from horse-drawn vehicles to 
            airplanes has been a fascinating journey that has transformed the way people and 
            goods move around the globe. Here's an overview of this remarkable transformation:
        </p>
        <p id="horse">
            <span>Horse-Drawn Vehicles (Pre-19th Century):</span> Before the 19th century, transportation relied 
            primarily on horses and other animals. People used horse-drawn carriages, wagons, and 
            sleighs for local travel and the transportation of goods.
        </p>
        <p id="motor">
            <span>Motor cycle (Late 19th Century):</span> The late 19th century saw the widespread adoption of bicycles,
            providing an affordable and efficient means of personal transportation.
        </p>
        <p id="car">        
            <span>Automobiles (Early 20th Century):</span> The development of the automobile in the early 20th century 
            transformed personal transportation. Henry Ford's assembly line revolutionized production, 
            making cars more affordable and accessible to the masses.
        </p>
        <p id="jet">
            <span>Jet Aircraft (Mid-20th Century):</span> The introduction of jet propulsion in aviation made air travel 
            faster and more practical for long distances.
        
            <span>Supersonic Aircraft (20th Century):</span> Supersonic passenger aircraft like the Concorde offered ultra-fast
            transatlantic travel, although they were eventually retired due to economic and environmental concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The transportation system has come a long way from relying on horses to encompassing a diverse range 
            of modes and technologies, including cars, trains, ships, airplanes, and even space travel. This evolution 
            has not only connected the world but also shaped economies, societies, and cultures in profound ways.
